Hello! I am **Wei Wang** (Vino), a PhD student in Learning, Design, and Technology at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I study how ICT and generative AI can support meaningful learning, assessment, and instructional design in higher education.

## Research focus

- GenAI integration in teaching and learning
- Educational data science and large-scale assessment
- Evaluation methods for technology-enabled learning

## Recent work

- Designing AI-assisted instructional models that promote critical thinking.
- Building tools and visualizations for large educational datasets in R and Python.
- Translating research into practical guidance for instructors and students.

I believe in the motto: **"Technology comes and goes, pedagogy never falls."** This guides my work toward grounded, human-centered learning experiences.
