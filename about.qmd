## About Me

Hello! My name is **Vino Wang**, a Ph.D. student in Learning, Design, and Technology at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. My research focuses on integrating ICT (Information and Communication Technology) into education, with a special interest in the transformative potential of generative AI in teaching and learning.

Over the past few years, I‚Äôve worked on various projects, including:
- Developing AI-driven teaching assistants to improve critical thinking in higher education.
- Designing innovative teaching materials for programming education.
- Conducting large-scale data analyses on educational outcomes using tools like R and Python.

I believe in the motto: **"Technology comes and goes, pedagogy never falls."** This philosophy guides my work as I strive to create impactful educational experiences.
