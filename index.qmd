# Researching how GenAI reshapes learning

I study how GenAI influences teaching, learning, and evaluation at scale. My work connects educational technology, data science, and research methods to support responsible, effective classroom integration.

- GenAI use in higher education and classroom practice
- Educational data science and large-scale assessment
- Evaluation methodology for technology-enabled learning
