Among these, I served as a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the **Online Course Delivery** training module.

This training, held from **November 4 to November 18, 2024**, focused on preparing educators to effectively deliver their courses in an online format. The program emphasized practical strategies, instructional techniques, and leveraging technology to enhance student engagement and course management.
