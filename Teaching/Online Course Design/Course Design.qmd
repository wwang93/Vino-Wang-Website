# Teaching and Training Experience

## Faculty Professional Development Program at UTK Digital Learning

As a Research Assistant (RA) at **UTK Digital Learning**, I actively contributed to faculty professional development initiatives aimed at improving online teaching and learning. One of the key projects I supported was the **Online Teaching & Learning Certificate Program**, designed to equip instructors and graduate students with the skills and knowledge to effectively deliver online courses.

### Online Course Design Training (Fall 2024)

As part of this program, I served as a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the **Online Course Design** training. This course, held from **September 9 to 23, 2024**, introduced participants to the principles of **Backward Design**, emphasizing the creation of aligned course outcomes, assessments, and learning activities.

#### Training Outcomes:

Participants who completed the training were able to: - Write specific and measurable course learning outcomes. - Design assessments and activities that align with course objectives. - Develop a two-week online instruction plan based on the **Backward Design Framework**.
