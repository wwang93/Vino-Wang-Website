## Overview

This session, presented at AECT 2024, explores the practical integration of **Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)**—such as ChatGPT and Bing Chat—into **faculty development programs** for designing effective and innovative assessments and learning activities, especially in asynchronous online courses.

## Key Points

- 🚀 **GenAI's Rise in Education**
    
    Tools like ChatGPT and Google Bard are reshaping higher education, offering human-like content generation but also raising pedagogical concerns.
    
- 🧠 **Educational Design Transformation**
    
    At the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK), GenAI has been embedded into the *CAS Online Course Design* program to support faculty in designing evidence-based learning activities.
    
- 🛠️ **Practical Application Demonstrated**
    
    Educators input learning outcomes into GenAI tools to generate customized assessments and activities. For example:
    
    - **Learning Outcome:** Distinguish differences between federal and state court systems.
    - **Assessment:** Comparative analysis essay.
    - **Activity:** Create interactive infographics or mind maps.
- 💬 **Faculty Feedback**
    
    Faculty found GenAI suggestions helpful but emphasized the need to adapt activities to the course format (e.g., avoiding live interviews in asynchronous settings).
    
- 📊 **Sentiment Analysis**
    
    Participant reflections were analyzed using the *Bing Sentiment Lexicon*, revealing a generally positive attitude toward GenAI as a supplementary tool.
    

## Design Process (Quick Guide)

1. Select a GenAI tool (ChatGPT, Bing Chat, etc.).
2. Use a prompt like:
    
    ```
    "What are some assessments and learning activities for a college-level asynchronous course that align with the following learning outcomes: [insert outcomes]?"
    
    ```
    
3. Review and critically reflect on the generated suggestions.
4. Select and adapt ideas suitable for your course structure and learning goals.

## Outcomes

- 🔄 Encouraged iterative design of assessments with GenAI as inspiration.
- 👥 Fostered collaboration and experience-sharing among faculty.
- 🎯 Supported alignment between learning outcomes and activities in online settings.

## Call to Action -Your Story Matters!!!
