    "text": "Abstract\nThe “Suspending Classes without Stopping Learning”, which is an emergency policy launched by the Chinese government to continue teaching activities as schools across the country, gives a new opportunity to popularize the application of E-learning space for college students. In order to explain college students’ continued learning intention toward E-learning space post COVID-19, this study combines theories from the fields of ECM-ISC (Expectation Confirmation Model for Information Systems Continuance). By adding two latent variables, namely students’ initial intention and teacher guidance factor, an improved ECM-ISC model for college students’ continued learning intention was put forward. Results from Linear regression analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) demonstrate a strong explanatory power of the new model. Based on the results of the empirical analysis, corresponding suggestions are proposed.\n \n\n\nCitation\nWang, W., Duan, Y., Wang, Q., and Liu, H. (2021).

    "title": "konfound: An R Sensitivity Analysis Package to Quantify the Robustness of Causal Inferences",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nQuantifying the Robustness of Inferences Sensitivity analysis, a statistical method crucial for validating inferences across disciplines, quantifies the conditions that could alter conclusions (Razavi et al., 2021). One line of work is rooted in linear models and foregrounds the sensitivity of inferences to the strength of omitted variables (Cinelli & Hazlett, 2019; Frank, 2000). A more recent approach is rooted in the potential outcomes framework for causal inference and foregrounds how hypothetical changes in a sample would alter an inference if such cases were otherwise observed (Frank et al., 2008, 2013; Frank & Min, 2007; Xu et al., 2019). One sensitivity measure is the Impact Threshold of a Confounding Variable, or ITCV, which generates statements about the correlation of an omitted, confounding variable with both a predictor of interest and the outcome (Frank, 2000). The ITCV index can be calculated for any linear model. The Robustness of an Inference to Replacement, RIR, assesses how replacing a certain percentage of cases with counterfactuals of zero treatment effect could nullify an inference (Frank et al., 2013). The RIR index is more general than the ITCV index. The sensitivity analysis techniques we describe in this paper and implement in the konfound R package differ from others in several ways. Unlike Linden et al. (2020), whose approach focuses on dichotomous outcomes and omitted variable sensitivity, our approach extends to continuous outcomes and evaluates both changes in estimates and standard errors. Oster (2019) focuses only on selection into the treatment based on unobservable variables versus observable variables necessary to nullify an estimate. The ITCV index focuses on the relationship of the unobservable to the predictor of interest and to the outcome. More generally, many others used simulation-based approaches, while our approach uses closed-form expressions to generate a single term representing sensitivity. These techniques, along with others, are reviewed and discussed (along with the ITCV and RIR approaches) in Frank et al. (2023). We have implemented the calculation of both the ITCV and RIR indices in the konfound R package. This package is intended to provide an easy-to-use and principled set of sensitivity techniques that are suitable for a range of model and dependent variable types and use cases. Its audience is broad: primarily social scientists, but also interested individuals in other disciplines (e.g., the health sciences). This paper provides an overview of two core functions within the konfound package, each of which can calculate the ITCV and RIR indices: konfound() and pkonfound(). These functions allow users to calculate the robustness of inferences using a model estimated (with R) or using information about a model from a published study, respectively. The konfound package is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=konfound; it can be installed via the install.packages(“konfound”) function within R\n \n\n\nCitation\nNarvaiz et al., (2024). konfound: An R Sensitivity Analysis Package to Quantify the Robustness of Causal Inferences.

My role was to design and implement an interactive visualization tool that shows how community college green program completions (“supply”) align with green-sector job postings (“demand”).\nCommunity colleges need to align their training programs with the rapidly growing green economy, while also ensuring equitable access. However, a nationwide, interactive visualization of this alignment is currently lacking.

Pre_supply_json.R converts ccrc_cip_comp.rds into point SF, selects instnm and inst_perc_green_tot, and exports InstituteData_&lt;year&gt;.json for each year. - Visualization Preprocessing: Pre_treemap.R aggregates green completions by program title, builds a per-year Plotly treemap list (Green_degree_treemap_plotly_list.rds). Pre_Plotly.R computes time-series of green job proportions by CZ and by SOC, converts ggplots to Plotly objects, and writes p_CZ_plotly.rds & p_SOC_plotly.rds."

    "text": "Steve Jobs\n\n\nIn my early twenties, I embarked on a life-changing journey when I founded a tutoring program for students in rural areas. The first time I stood in front of my students, I shared with them one of the most impactful speeches I’ve ever encountered: Steve Jobs’ commencement address at Stanford University, where he famously said, “Stay hungry, stay foolish.” This was also the first time I used multimedia to teach these children, a moment that sparked my deep fascination with educational technology—a field that I’ve continued to explore ever since.\nThat speech became a cornerstone of my personal and professional philosophy, especially that timeless phrase, “stay hungry, stay foolish.” It has guided me over the past decade as I navigated the intersections of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and education. Jobs’ reflection on why technology had transformed almost every industry but had left education relatively untouched deeply resonated with me. This question remains a challenge for researchers and practitioners in the educational technology field today, as we continue to strive to find ways for technological advancements to meaningfully impact learning and teaching.\nOver the years, I’ve witnessed the world of educational technology evolve through various phases—from the rise of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) to the era of mobile learning, and now, the dawn of artificial intelligence in education. Each wave of innovation has offered new tools and opportunities, but the fundamental question of how to create lasting, transformative change in education remains as vital as ever.\nRevisiting this speech today, I find myself reflecting on why I chose to enter the field of educational technology in the first place. Steve Jobs’ words served as a guiding light during my formative years, pushing me to remain curious, open-minded, and bold in my pursuit of solutions. As I look ahead to the next ten years, my hope is to contribute new perspectives and breakthroughs to the ongoing conversation about the role of technology in education.\nHere’s to staying hungry and staying foolish, as I continue this journey. video:Stay hungry Stay foolish"

We used the public internet data mining approach from previous years (Allman et al., 2023b; Kimmons, 2020; Kimmons & Rosenberg, 2022; Kimmons et al., 2021). This year, we extracted and analyzed data from the Scopus research article database, K-12 school and district Facebook pages, and the open publishing platform EdTech Books. We also looked closer at two key terms—“artificial intelligence” and “OER”—using Google Custom Search API to examine patterns in the higher education context and the description of resources from the Teachers Pay Teachers (TPT) website for insights in the K-12 context. This year, we no longer utilized the X (formerly Twitter) #EdTech affinity group as a data source because of the changes to the platform/accessibility of the data. Our analysis represents snapshots of 2023 trends in educational technology from these dataset angles, furthering our understanding of current EdTech community’s attitudes, behaviors, and leanings and underpinning a predictive vision of future trends in the field.\n \n\n\nCitation\nAllman, B., Kimmons, R., Wang, W. et al. Trends and Topics in Educational Technology, 2024 Edition.

Drawing on the Expectation-Confirmation Model for Information Systems Continuance (ECM-ISC) and the Interaction of Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution (I-PACE) model, the research investigates how satisfaction, affect, and personality traits influence students’ intention to use AI tools and, through reflective cognitive engagement, enhance their creative performance. Data were collected from 288 undergraduate students via a structured questionnaire and analyzed using path analysis. The findings indicate that while satisfaction, affect, and personality traits significantly boost the intention to use AI, this intention impacts creativity only indirectly through cognitive response.
